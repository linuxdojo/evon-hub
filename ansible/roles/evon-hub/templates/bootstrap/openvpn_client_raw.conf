# Evon Hub - OpenVPN Server Connection Config
###############################################

# Use this OpenVPN Client config file to connect a Server to your Evon Hub.
#
# *** WARNING: ***
#
# It is highly recommended that you disable Discovery Mode and use whitelists
# in your Evon Hub's configuration before using this config file to nullify
# the risk of rogue servers joining your hub if this file leaks.
#
# It is also recommended to use the `user` and `group` options in this config
# file to drop privileges of the openvpn process to a non-root user after it
# is initialised.
#
# Usage:
#
# Create a file /etc/openvpn/evon.uuid with the following contents:
#
#   <uuid>
#   <hostname>
#
# Where:
#
# <uuid> is a unique UUIDv4 value, as outputted by the `uuidgen` command,
# eg '5391e02d-31b3-47d9-a265-8e87b3910183'. Add this UUID to the whitelist
# in your Hub's configuration page.
#
# <hostname> is the name of this server as it will appear in your Hub's Server
# list. Eg, if <hostname> is set to 'webserver1', then this host will be given
# the name: webserver1.{{ account_domain }}
#
# Ensure the /etc/openvpn/evon.uuid has mode 600 (read/write by owner only) for
# security. For more info, refer to the --auth-user-pass option in the OpenVPN
# manual at https://openvpn.net
#
# Note that OpenVPN's standard "username" and "password" fields are utilised for
# <UUID> and <hostname> respectively should you need to provide alternate means
# of authentication instead of via the auth-user-pass file. Evon Hub's security
# model is based on the server certificate and whitelisted UUID's for
# authentication and authorisation governing network access and permitted
# connectivity.
#
# Example /etc/openvpn/evon.uuid file contents (don't use this example UUID!):
#
#   5391e02d-31b3-47d9-a265-8e87b3910183
#   webserver1
#
# Start and persist your OpenVPN service using this file, or run directly with
# command:
#
#   sudo openvpn <path_to_this_file>
#
# Ensure your server can reach {{ account_domain }} on TCP/443 in order to
# connect successfully, or configure a proxy server should you need to hop
# through one to access your Hub.
